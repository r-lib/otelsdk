High-quality, ubiquitous, and portable telemetry to enable effective observability. [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/) is a collection of tools, APIs, and SDKs used to instrument, generate, collect, and export telemetry data (metrics, logs, and traces) for analysis in order to understand your software's performance and behavior.

Use the [otel](https://github.com/r-lib/otel) package as a dependency if you want to instrument your R package or project for OpenTelemetry.

Use this package (otelsdk) to produce OpenTelemetry output from an R package or project that was instrumented with the otel package.

## Installation

> [!WARNING]
> This package is experimental and may introduce breaking changes any time.
> It probably works best with the latest commit of the
> [otel](https://github.com/r-lib/otel) package.

You can install the development version of otel from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("r-lib/otelsdk")
```

## Usage

* Instrument your R package or project using the
  [otel](https://github.com/r-lib/otel) package.
* Choose an exporter from the otelsdk package. The `http` exporter sends
  OpenTelemetry output through OTLP/HTTP.
* Set the `OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER` environment variable to point to the
  exporter of your choice. E.g. for OTLP/HTTP set `OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER=http`.
* If you are sending telemetry data through HTTP, then you typically need
  to configure the URL of your OpenTelemetry collector, and you possibly
  also need to supply a token in an HTTP header, possibly some resource
  attributes. Follow the instructions of the provider of your collector.
  They typically don't have instructions for R, but generic instructions
  about environment variables will work for the otelsdk R package. E.g. for
  [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) you need something like
  ```
  OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL="http"
  OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT="https://otlp-gateway-prod-eu-central-0.grafana.net/otlp" \
  OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES="service.name=<name-of-your-app>,service.namespace=<name-of-your-namespace>,deployment.environment=test"
  OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS="Authorization=Basic%20<base64-encoded-token>"
  ```
  See more example below.
* Start R and your app. Telemetry data will be exported to the chosen exporter.

### Setup for remote collectors

There are a lot of services that offer an OpenTelemetry collector for
tracers, logs and metrics, many of them supporting all three of them.
There are also local apps that work as a collector. We tried otelsdk with
the following ones:

#### [Grafana](https://grafana.com/)

Follow the [documentation](
  https://grafana.com/docs/grafana-cloud/send-data/otlp/send-data-otlp/#manual-opentelemetry-setup-for-advanced-users
).
Create an API token. You'll need to use the Grafana instrance ID as your
username, and the token as the password in HTTP Basic auth. E.g. in R do
this to get the base64 encoded token. `instance-id` is a (currently seven
digit) number and a string with a `glc_` prefix.
```r
openssl::base64_encode("<instance-id>:<api-token>")
```
Then use this encoded token to set the `Authorization` header:
```
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL="http"
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT="https://otlp-gateway-prod-eu-central-0.grafana.net/otlp" \
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS="Authorization=Basic%20<base64-encoded-token>"
OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES="service.name=<name-of-your-app,service.namespace=<name-of-your-namespace>,deployment.environment=test"
```

Your endpoint URL is probably different, use the one that you see on your
dashboard.

If you want to export logs and/or metrics, set these environment variables,
respectively:
```

OTEL_LOGS_EXPORTER=http
OTEL_LOG_LEVEL=debug
OTEL_METRICS_EXPORTER=http
```
It also makes sense to set the desired log level.

Grafana suggests running an OpenTelemetry collector on premise instead of
sending telemetry data to them directly. But nevertheless you can start out
without running your own collector, they call this "quick start" mode.

#### [Pydantic Logfire](https://pydantic.dev/logfire)

Create a project and a write token. Note that the URLs you need to use
are different if you are within the EU! You probably need to replace `us`
with `eu` in the URL if you are in the EU. Set these environment variables:
```
OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER=http
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT="https://logfire-us.pydantic.dev"
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS="Authorization=<your-write-token>"
```
For logs also set `OTEL_LOGS_EXPORTER` and the desired log level:
```
OTEL_LOGS_EXPORTER=http
OTEL_LOG_LEVEL=debug
```
For exporting metrics also set
```
OTEL_METRICS_EXPORTER=http
```

### Setup for local collectors

#### [otel-tui](https://github.com/ymtdzzz/otel-tui)

`otel-tui` is a terminal app that supports traces, logs and metrics.
It is great for development, as you can keep all your telemetry local while
instrumenting your package or app. Follow the installation instructions and
then run the app from a terminal:
```
otel-tui
```
It listens on the default port, so the setup is very simple, set these
environment variables (or a subset if you don't want metrics or logs):
```
OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER=http
OTEL_LOGS_EXPORTER=http
OTEL_LOG_LEVEL=debug
OTEL_METRICS_EXPORTER=http
```

#### [otel-desktop-viewer](https://github.com/CtrlSpice/otel-desktop-viewer)

`otel-desktop-viewer` is similar to `otel-tui`, but has a web UI. Follow
the installation instructions and start the app from a terminal:
```
otel-desktop-viewer
```
It should start a new windows or tab in your local web browser. Set the
usual environment variable for your R app:
```
OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER=http
```

#### [Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io/)

If you have Docker, you can start a
[Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io/) container on the default port:
```
docker run --rm --name jaeger \
 -p 16686:16686 \
 -p 4317:4317 \
 -p 4318:4318 \
 -p 5778:5778 \
 -p 9411:9411 \
 jaegertracing/jaeger:2.4.0
```

Go to `http://localhost:16686/` to view the Jaeger UI.

#### [SigNoz](https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz)

To run SigNoz locally with Docker, clone the repository at
https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz:
```
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz
```
and then run Docker Compose from the `deploy/docker/` subdirectory:
```
cd deploy/docker
docker compose up
```

Go to `http://localhost:8080` to see the SigNoz UI.
